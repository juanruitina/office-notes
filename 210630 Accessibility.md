## Product vision - Andrea Wong

- Questions to ask in the user research process:
  - How do you use your assistive technologies?
  - How does your impairment impact or not impact your interactions?
  - Which workarounds, if any, do you use to get what you need?
- See how users with disabilities use assistive technologies in online videos.
  - Assistive technologies: keyboard, screen reader, switch device, braille keyboard, voice control
- Build a better experience for _all_ users and capture more market share

  - People with disabilities have over $21b of disposable income in the US (American Institute of Research): 3rd largest market segment.
  - $8t worldwide including family and friends, according to Gartner

## Design - Catherine Idylle

- Design tab interaction model
- Don't forget arrow keys for navigation

## Visuals - Bethany Fong

- Ensure good colour contract. [Material color tool](https://material.io/resources/color/)
- Multiple visible indicators for component states: orange for error, use also icon, text
- Large touch target size: 48x48dp, 7mm big target

## Writing & motion - Catherine Idylle

- Add meaningful and concise accessory labels
- Motion design: disappearing elements are a major pain point. Present alerts for long enough and easily dismiss them.
- Easily escape hover information on screen magnification
