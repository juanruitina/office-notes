## Focus

Tab / Shift+Tab. Tab order.

Some elements are implicitly focusable: input, button, select. Others are not (e.g. headings)

DOM order matters: check tab order frequently to make sure you didn't mess it up

- tabindex="-1": not in natural tab order, can be programmatically focused with focus() (e.g. ```document.querySelector('#modal').focus()```). Useful for modals.
- tabindex="0": in natural tab order (even if it isn't implicitly focusable!), can be programmatically focused
- tabindex="5": in natural tab order, jumped to the front of tab order, anti-pattern!!!! Move up in the dom instead.

Only add focus to elements that require input, interaction, NOT to content.

Managing focus: e.g. internal links, single page applications. Add tabindex="-1" to headers, use focus() method.

Roving focus: use tabindex="0" checked, tabindex="-1"

document.activeElement in console returns the element that is currently active, even if it's hidden

Keyboard trap: focus is never locked. BUT on modals it can be useful: e.g. 'open'.
